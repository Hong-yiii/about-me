title: "So what do I build?"
excerpt: "Solutions. To work on Interdiciplinary problems with equally diverse teams is my ideal. Thriving at the intersection of mechanical systems, electronics, software development and design, I always try to approach problems holistically. \n
Whether itâ€™s designing aerodynamic solutions, coding machine learning algorithms, or crafting intuitive user experiences, I leverage my diverse skills to build efficient, impactful, and scalable solutions."
