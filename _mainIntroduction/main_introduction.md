title: "So what do I build?"
excerpt: "I enjoy tackling interdiciplinary problems. Thriving at the intersection of mechanical systems, electronics, software development and system design, I always try to approach problems holistically. \n
Whether itâ€™s iterating on aerodynamic designs, building AI agents, or crafting intuitive user experiences, I leverage my diverse skills to build efficient, impactful, and scalable solutions."
