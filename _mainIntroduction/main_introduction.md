## Hi, I’m Hong Yi

I’m an Engineering Science undergrad at the National University of Singapore who enjoys building at the intersection of AI systems, robotics, and distributed infrastructure.  
I like taking messy, interdisciplinary problems;from drone racing and robot logistics to multi-agent retrieval systems;and turning them into robust, scalable products.

Recently, I’ve been:
- **Building retrieval and agentic systems** as Founder / Tech Lead at *Framed*, designing an OpenCLIP-based retrieval pipeline and multi-stage ranking stack for photo curation.
- **Orchestrating multi-agent workflows** as an ML Engineer at *Bot Noi Group (NOC Bangkok)*, where I worked on A2A-based routing, provider-agnostic DevKit design, and cost-efficient context management.
- **Scaling robotics and perception systems** using RL to trian a racing drone & drone swarm simulations, working across data collection, reinforcement learning and computer vision model training.
<br>
If a project touches AI orchestration, natural language processing, or complex system design, I’m usually interested.

Outside of work, I'm addicted to Tennis and Skiing!
